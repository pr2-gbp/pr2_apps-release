  * Only warn the user on outdated repeated messages
    dornhege's commit recently added a safety mechanism to ensure
    a properly working dead-man switch with the PS2 controller.
    However, in some setups this problem appears during normal operation
    but does not persist for long. In order to avoid spamming the log
    console, we warn the user only if the received messages are additionally
    out of date.
    The overall safety mechanism still triggers, this only affects the log.
  * use desired position for head feedback
    With the actual position the head tilts down because of gravity
    when the controller is idle and head movements are less responsive.
  * Pan and tilt values updated via state controller
    When controlling the head with a different controller, the head moved with a very high speed, which can be harmful to the hardware.
    It was assumed that the head was only moved via teleop, thus the position was not updated when the head was moved with a different controller.
    This was fixed by reading the actual values for pan and tilt from the state controller.

    Do not process the same joystick message twice.
  * Do not process the same joystick message twice.
